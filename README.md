Version: 1.0.5

# Intro

This is a curated list of the awesome must-use extensions I use every day :D

* _All extension links are to the official Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace_
* _Themes and icons are not included in the list_
* _I consider the _activation time_, filesize and usefulness all into account when considering adding new extensions_

Extensions add or change functionality within Visual Studio Code and are free from cost.

The easiest way to install them is to use the in-app "extensions" section of Visual Studio Code left sidebar
and search the exact names below (headers).

The links have more details about each extension, including any related keyboard shortcuts.

Tip: Be sure to disable any extensions, themes and icons that you may use in the future and remove extensions you won't use again.
This will help keep Visual Studio Code's performance up to scratch, especially during startup.

# Language Packs üåê

Official Language Packs for non-US coders are available: [Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=Microsoft&target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Name)

Language Packs allow the Visual Studio interface to show in your preferred language (for popular languages).

I personally use: [English (United Kingdom) Language Pack for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-en-GB)

# Recommended Extensions

For improved performance be sure to use [workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) and disable extensions that don't need to run within the workspace.
